# Software Reliability Model - reliability-model

This Software Reliability Model (SRM) provides a flexible and explainable model of software reliability in terms of technical foundations, socio-technical constraints, and human factors. It is designed to help explore and explain software reliability to people of various roles who are involved in building and running software systems (especially when on-boarding new team members), and track progress in improving reliability. The SRM is also designed to make it easy to generate and update hierarchical metrics for product health scores across multiple teams.

The software reliability model is designed to be relevant to several different kinds of software systems:

* internet and cloud-based software
* desktop software
* IoT and embedded software
* (combinations of the above)

The different team measures, context, and genres of influences are linked to create a graph that helps to explain the dynamics around software reliability. The graph is then visualised using the visualisation tool [Kumu](https://kumu.io/).

## Audience

The SRM is aimed at these kinds of people:

* Product Owner / Product Manager
* [SRE](https://sre.google/) Manager / [SRE](https://sre.google/) Lead
* Software Architect / Systems Architect / Test Architect
* Software Developer
* Software Tester

The SRM helps these people to explore and discuss different aspects of software reliability to help make targeted improvements.

## What's in the SRM?

The SRM is composed of 2 main parts:

1. definitions of reliability factors in CSV format suitable for import to [Kumu](https://kumu.io/) ðŸ“„
2. graphs in [Kumu](https://kumu.io/) generated by importing the CSV definitions ðŸ“Š

The CSV files (and visualisation settings) are imported into Kumu to generate explorable graphs.

# Types of factors in the model

There are several types of factors in the SRM - each factor type is shown differently in the Kumu graph:

* team measure - team-level measures that influence reliability
* context - the context in which measures are taken
* genre - the high-level grouping of measures
* reliability - the ultimate goal of all these factors

## Tags to help explore the model

Tags are used to explore different dimensions of the model:

* 4 Key Metrics - from the book [_Accelerate_](https://itrevolution.com/book/accelerate/):
  - lead time
  - deployment frequency
  - Mean Time To Restore (MTTR)
  - Change failure rate
* CodeScene - measures from the tool CodeScene (see [CodeScene.io](https://codescene.io/))
* Continuous Delivery - measures from the Continuous Delivery dimension of MSDA
* Deployment - measures from the Deployment dimension of MSDA
* Deployment technique - techniques for reliability focused on deployment aspects
* Flow - measures from the Flow dimension of MSDA
* Human technique - techniques for reliability focused on human aspects
* MSDA - measures from [Multi-team Software Delivery Assessment (MSDA)](http://softwaredeliveryassessment.com/)
* On-call - measures from the On-call dimension of MSDA
* Operability - measures from the OPerability dimension of MSDA
* RTCE - measures from the [Reliability Through Customer Eyes (RTCE)](http://rtce.net/) principles devised by TELUS and Conflux.
* Reliability and SRE - measures from the Reliability dimension of MSDA
* Runtime technique - techniques for reliability focused on runtime aspects

# Notes on the model and visualization

1. Names of Kumu element types, connection types, and tags are ["selector friendly" for the Kumu advanced editor](https://docs.kumu.io/guides/import.html#try-to-be-selector-friendly) - a single word.
2. The graph layout visualization is controlled by the settings in the `*.css` view files (imported into the [Advanced Editor](https://docs.kumu.io/overview/view-editors.html#advanced-editor) settings in Kumu).

* Use CI to test Pull Requests against Kumu import:
  - Duplicate nodes?
  - Dangling connectors?
